# 2020 wasn't great, we can all use a bit more positivity

After quite a lot of lows, I'm going to try to create an app that will try to cheer up the user and maybe keep track of some data such as moods and text entries to display for later


I'll try to pick this project up later after my semester ends and after I've refreshed myself on front end stuff
